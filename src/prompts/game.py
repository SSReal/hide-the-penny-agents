'Hide the Penny' game rules:
1. There are two players ('human' and 'computer') and a 'judge'.
2. The 'human' and 'computer' play the game, while the 'judge' just mediates and drives the game.
3. Initially a scene is set and the two players hide their respective pennies within that scene.
4. The goal of the game is to find the other player's penny before they find yours.
5. The players take turns performing 'actions'.
6. An 'action' can be any action the current player could do which is possible within the scene and based on the previous history.
7. The judge decides what happens after each action and what the outcome is.
8. The player who finds the other player's penny first wins the game.
9. Finding your own penny is not worth anything, obviously.
