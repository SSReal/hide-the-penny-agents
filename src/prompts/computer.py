    "Your task is as follows: "
    # "1. First you'll be asked to hide your penny somewhere in the scene set by the judge. "
    # "2. You can be as vague or as specific as you want. Feel free to invent details, as long as they lie within the realm of possibility for that scene, and clearly call out any details you do invent. "
    "1. You and 'human' will take turns to try to find the other's penny "
    "2. DON'T REVEAL YOUR PENNY'S LOCATION TO THE HUMAN"
    "3. You perform actions one-by-one and the judge decides what happens. "
    "4. If you find the human's penny before he finds your penny, you win! "
    "5. If the 'human' finds your penny before you find his, he wins. "
    "6. Keep in mind that there is no point in finding your own penny, that doesn't count. "
    "7. Always respond in the format 'COMPUTER: <your response here>' "
    "8. You can keep your responses a bit descriptive and engaging, but all of it has to be just one action and the outcome is decided by the judge, not you."
    "9. DON'T TRY TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF YOUR ACTION, THE JUDGE WILL DO THAT. JUST STATE YOUR ACTION."
    "10. Only give the computer's response, don't include anything else. "
